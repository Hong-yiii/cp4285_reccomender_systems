# AI assistance log

## 25 September 2026 — Project initialization

**Tool:** OpenAI Codex, including two internal agents for independent transcript synthesis and technical checking.

**User request:** Understand the CP4285 project from the supplied meeting notes and diagram, propose what to do first for user verification, and initialize a folder of Markdown notes.

**Inputs:** Supplied transcript and sketch; repository context; public course schedule, assignments, lecture slides and critique template; narrowly selected primary technical sources listed in SOURCES.md.

**Assistance provided:** Reconstructed the discussion and tentative roles; checked public assessment details; identified methodological ambiguities; proposed an experiment definition and critique preparation sequence; created this folder and updated the repository map.

**Human decisions pending:** Verify project interpretation, final scope, data/model choices, roles, deadline, and current team progress. None of the proposed experimental decisions is represented as team-approved.

**Artifacts and limits:** Markdown working notes and preserved source copies. No training, measured results, submitted work, external messages, or created slide deck.

This is a summary record, not a full prompt transcript. Retain the Codex conversation and add later prompts/outputs used by the team when preparing its collective AI-use documentation. This initialization does not establish how other teammates have used AI.

## 25 September 2026 — Neural workstream validation

**User clarification/request:** Hongyi owns the modern recommender contribution; validate the assumptions that modern models learn continually, that initial training is followed by learning during deployment, and that mixed-domain continued training is a valid experiment. Read and critique the supplied prior agent chat, then formalize the setup.

**Assistance provided:** Distinguished model architecture, changing inference inputs and actual parameter updates; checked SASRec, ADER, Monolith and CCTL primary sources; proposed a shared neural model and explicit training/evaluation controls. Preserved the supplied chat and added MODERN-RECOMMENDER.md. No new subagents were used for this follow-up.

**Status:** Role confirmed; architecture and implementation choices remain proposals. No experiments or results generated. Mathematical reasoning and proposed controls are agent analysis, not findings attributed to papers or the team.

## 27 September 2026 — SASRec paper walkthrough

**User request:** Explain the SASRec paper and how it fits the experiment.

**Assistance:** Read the original architecture, training and evaluation sections, visually inspected Figure 1, checked the authors' model/evaluation code and the official Week 05 SASRec material. Explained sequence representations versus persistent model weights, and separated the published model from the proposed continual-training protocol. Preserved the original paper locally (now `local/sources/sasrec-2018.pdf` after migration). No model selection was finalized and no experiment was run.

## 27 September 2026 — Continued-training specification

**User request:** Formalize adding continued training to the proposed SASRec experiment.

**Assistance:** Created CONTINUED-TRAINING.md with initial and continued phases, next-item objective, mixture accounting, optimizer-state policy, pseudocode, fixed test protocol and controls. Rechecked the original SASRec and ADER sources. The proposed defaults and equations are working design assistance; no dataset, architecture or numerical training budget has been finalized. No training code or empirical result was produced.

## 28 September 2026 — Scoped critique preparation

**User request:** Review the Group 3 PDF, break down requirements and scope preparation to Hongyi's modern-recommender work.

**Assistance:** Read all deck text and visually inspected relevant pages; compared with the preserved official template; expanded DEFENSE.md with page-specific gaps, neural preparation, controls, mixture definitions and rehearsal questions. Rechecked SASRec and ADER, including the draft's inaccurate RNN/YouTube reference.

**Limits:** PDF unchanged; no submission or experiment performed. No compute access, dataset approval or implementation progress inferred. Recommendations remain AI-assisted preparation for user/team verification.

## 28 September 2026 — Slide narrative and diagrams

**Request:** Provide diagrams and work out a logical slide flow for the neural contribution.

**Assistance:** Created SLIDE-FLOW.md with four editable Mermaid diagrams for SASRec inference, proposed shared-domain architecture, continued updates and comparison conditions. Added speaker notes and placement within the existing group sections. No slide deck was modified, no experiment was run and no synthetic performance results were drawn.

## 28 September 2026 — Dataset suitability review

**Request:** Evaluate Amazon Reviews 2023 Electronics/Movies & TV and DIGINETICA/YOOCHOOSE for the continued-training study, including a teammate's reference-paper interpretation.

**Assistance:** Checked official Amazon schema/processing statistics, ADER paper and repository, CCTL experiment setup and YOOCHOOSE authors' documentation. Created DATASET-ASSESSMENT.md with a provisional Amazon recommendation, limitations and feasibility criteria. Flagged the difference between ADER's separate temporal benchmarks and the proposed cross-dataset mixture, and the need to audit parameter sharing in the classical comparison.

**Limits:** Documentation assessment only. No full interaction files downloaded, overlap measured, dataset choice finalized, training run or performance claim made. The teammate's exact intended Amazon paper remains unidentified.

## 28 September 2026 — uv initialization and HTML update

**Request:** Initialize the existing repository for the proposed audit/target/design/A-only-pilot steps using uv, install dependencies and update the supplied HTML.

**Assistance:** Added pyproject/lockfile, a local Python 3.12 environment, configurable data audit/preparation commands, an official ID-file downloader, a SASRec-style A-only checkpoint/continuation pilot, meaningful tests and implementation documentation. Updated the existing HTML to six slides with Amazon dataset details, review-event semantics and explicit implementation gates. Preserved the existing Git repository.

**Validation:** Seven tests and lint/format checks passed. A synthetic end-to-end run reproduced evaluation after checkpoint reload with zero maximum score difference and verified a fixed frozen control. Browser review covers slide navigation, speaker notes and layout.

**Limits:** No Amazon interaction downloads or real-data metrics. Dataset selection, review target and time cutoffs remain provisional. A-only code does not yet implement B interfaces, mixed updates, classical models, exact SASRec paper replication or a final multi-seed study. The target defaults to all review events and can be changed through the rating filter.

## 28 September 2026 — Standalone repository and Pi handoff

**Tool:** OpenAI assistant in Pi, with independent read-only scout and reviewer agents.

**Request:** Make a standalone public `cp4285_reccomender_systems` repository, reorganize the existing project and context/slides, and redirect the course workspace to the new project home.

**Assistance:** Migrated code/tests and locked environment metadata; separated `configs/`, `docs/` and editable `slides/`; updated runtime/documentation paths; added README, CONTEXT and AGENTS entry points plus a layout regression check. Retained source evidence, course PDFs, draft team PDF and previous synthetic runs locally behind Git ignores. Removed private attachment paths and teammate identifiers from public summaries. Backed up the source project and redirected the course workspace without importing unrelated course Git history.

**Validation:** Locked environment installed; all 8 tests, Ruff lint/format and the synthetic CLI smoke check passed. A separate export containing only the 29 publishable files installed and passed all 8 tests without local/course sources; its synthetic demo passed on a direct retry after a combined validation task timed out. Both completed smoke checks reproduced checkpoint scores with zero maximum difference. Relative Markdown links, the old workspace redirect, source-copy integrity and Git ignores were checked. Gitleaks found no secrets in the public-only export; independent migration review reported no findings. Static diagnostics were not fully clean: stale environment/import findings and a pre-existing optional-checkpoint type warning remain, with details retained locally.

**Limits:** No new research decisions, data downloads, real-data results, final submission, license grant or deployment. Published notes remain AI-assisted working material, not team approval. Historical source files and runs retain their original contents; machine-specific migration details live only in `local/WORKSPACE.md`.

## 28 September 2026 — Implementation code review

**Tool:** Cursor Grok 4.7.

**Request:** Review the implemented audit, split, SASRec-style model and A-only pilot.

**Assistance:** Read the package, tests, pilot config and runbook. Compared the code with the stated holdout, checkpoint and evaluation contract. Did not change research decisions, download data, or treat synthetic checks as Amazon results.

**Findings to verify:** Right-padded histories give the prediction token a length-dependent position id. Validation and retention share one prefix, so checkpoint selection and the retention metric are two labels on one score vector. Out-of-vocabulary drops can put different users in those two splits. Download promotion checks the CSV header and does not read the gzip checksum. Prepare/audit outputs can be overwritten; DuckDB spill uses a working-directory-relative path.

**Validation:** `uv run pytest -q` passed, 8 tests. No code changes.

## 28 September 2026 — Original SASRec architecture

**Tool:** OpenAI assistant in Pi, with read-only upstream research and independent code review.

**User decision:** Use the original [kang205/SASRec](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec) immediately rather than the generic Transformer pilot.

**Assistance:** Inspected and pinned upstream commit `e3738967fddab206d6eeb4fda433e7a7034dd8b1`. Ported its architecture from Python 2 / TensorFlow 1.12 to the existing PyTorch runtime, preserving normalized residuals, raw K/V, masking, hidden-width feedforward, tied scoring and sampled loss. Adopted fixed left-padding, original architecture defaults, sequence-wise initial supervision with user sampling and Adam beta2=0.98. Continuation still masks historical targets to avoid implicit replay. Added source/license notices, checkpoint provenance and explicit protocol differences in SASREC.md. The earlier Cursor review entry above is preserved unchanged.

**Validation:** All 11 tests, Ruff lint and formatting passed. Tests include a separate NumPy translation of upstream forward/loss equations (one and two heads), causal isolation, finite gradients, training masks, holdout exclusion and checkpoint lifecycle. The full configured model completed a synthetic demo with zero reload score difference and unchanged frozen control. Independent source-fidelity review reported no findings. Source/wheel builds passed, and the wheel was checked for the Apache license and attribution notice.

**Limits:** This is a PyTorch port, not execution of the legacy TensorFlow code. No TensorFlow numerical comparison, original-paper benchmark reproduction or real Amazon experiment was performed. The model is selected; the two-domain design, final dataset and training budget are not thereby approved. Earlier generic-model checkpoints are incompatible. Existing data-audit/download concerns recorded in the Cursor review are outside this model change.

## 28 September 2026 — Classical comparator

**Tool:** Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5).

**Request:** Explore non-deep-learning (matrix-factorisation / QR-based) recommenders for the project, build a baseline to iterate on, implement a classical method from the literature (SLIST), and integrate it into this repository.

**Assistance:** Downloaded the official 5-core Electronics and Movies & TV ID files (plus the unfiltered Movies & TV file) and measured A/B overlap. Implemented `src/cp4285/classical/`: DuckDB loader with shared original user IDs, leave-last-out split, disjoint and shared-user contamination designs, popularity, raw and QR-factorised Markov chains, user-item PureSVD with a QR-based incremental variant, and SLIST ported from the authors' code. Added `cp4285 classical` subcommands, eight tests, SciPy as a dependency and CLASSICAL.md with the first real-data sweeps.

**Validation:** 16 tests plus Ruff lint and format passed. CLI smoke test on real data. Full-data sweeps ran on a laptop (validation split, one seed).

**Limits:** Exploratory single-seed numbers with lightly chosen hyperparameters (SLIST α and age decay compared on validation). The protocol is leave-last-out, not the pilot's cutoff design, so neural and classical numbers are not yet comparable. No Diginetica run, no team approval of model choice implied.

## 28 September 2026 — SASRec PR and workstream integration

**Tool:** OpenAI assistant in Pi, with independent read-only review.

**Request:** PR the current work into main, then continue to the next checkpoint.

**Assistance:** Reviewed and published the original-SASRec changes in PR #2. Main advanced with the teammate's classical comparator (PR #1); merged that work without dropping its CLI, dependency, tests or AI log. Reconciled status notes to distinguish the synthetic neural cutoff pilot from contributor-reported real-data classical leave-last-out sweeps. Preserved the Cursor review and existing slide formatting.

**Validation:** The combined suite passed all 21 tests, Ruff lint/format, CLI doctor/classical help and source/wheel builds. Both SASRec-only and combined public exports passed Gitleaks. Integration review identified an unguarded classical config preparse and unqualified result provenance; fixed both, first reproducing missing/malformed-config failures with two regression cases. Follow-up review confirmed the working-tree fixes. The classical real-data sweeps were not rerun during integration.

**Limits:** No data downloads, common-protocol model comparison, protocol approval or course submission. The next implementation checkpoint is download integrity and non-overwriting artifact persistence; research decisions remain explicit gates.
